A. Highscore Leaderboard Data

To provide the competitive leaderboard feature, we collect the following when you voluntarily submit your score:

    Username: A display name of your choice.

    Country: Your approximate location (country) to display your national flag.

    Score: Your game performance results. Legal Basis: Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). This data is public to other players.

B. Third-Party Services (Advertising & Analytics)

We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:

    Google AdMob: Used for advertisements. AdMob collects the Android Advertising ID (AAID) and IP address to show personalized or non-personalized ads and for fraud prevention. Users in the EEA and USA are presented with a consent management form to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads. You can change your choices at any time in the app's 'Settings' menu.

C. App Infrastructure (WebView)

Our app uses a "Web-to-Native" wrapper (WebView). This technology may store local cache and standard cookies on your device to improve performance. We do not access these cookies for tracking purposes.

3. Log Data

In case of an error in the app, we collect "Log Data" via third-party products. This may include your device IP address, device name, operating system version, and the time/date of your use. This is used solely for debugging and improving the Service.

4. Data Retention and Security

    Retention: Leaderboard data is stored as long as the leaderboard is active. You can request deletion at any time.

    Security: We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transmitted between the app and our servers. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.


5. Children’s Privacy

Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we discover such data has been collected, we will delete it immediately.
